SK8SOUND's Sonic Design Interaction Patch
//////////////
SK8SOUND is a project from Mobility Lab creative researchers.
In this project, the final step of the tech chain was a sonification from movements of the skates as a triad coreography. 
That's the piece of code which performed the sonic interaction.
